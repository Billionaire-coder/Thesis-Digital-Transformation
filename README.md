# Sovereign Engine: Master's Thesis Digital Transformation

**A multi-paradigm digital interface for the "Sovereign Engine" Master's Thesis.**

This repository contains the source code and assets for a progressive web-based exploration of the "Sovereign Engine" thesis. The project demonstrates the evolution of a digital document from a static file into an immersive, agentic experience.

## 📂 Project Structure

The core of the project revolves around five distinct "Master" HTML files, each representing a radically different user interface and design philosophy for consuming the same underlying thesis content.

### 1. `Master.html` (The Original / Cyberpunk)
*   **Theme**: 2030 Neon Cyberpunk.
*   **Features**: WebGL starfield, 3D carousels, glitch text effects, HUD overlays.
*   **Vibe**: "The Future is Now."

### 2. `Master2.html` (Sovereign OS)
*   **Theme**: Industrial Desktop Operating System.
*   **Features**: Draggable windows, taskbar, terminal simulator, file explorer.
*   **Interaction**: Users "boot into" the system and manage the thesis as files within an OS.

### 3. `Master3.html` (Kinetic Velocity)
*   **Theme**: Brutalist / Acid Graphic Design.
*   **Features**: Massive scrolling typography, 3D parallax grid, diagonal marquees, cursor effects.
*   **Vibe**: High-energy, motion-heavy visual impact.

### 4. `Master4.html` (Sovereign Spatial)
*   **Theme**: "Vision Pro" / Ethereal Spatial Computing.
*   **Features**: Glassmorphism, 3D tilt-sensitive cards, animated "Aura" background.
*   **Vibe**: Weightless, premium, future-tech interface.

### 5. `Master5.html` (Strategic Command) - *The Final Version*
*   **Theme**: Premium Editorial / Swiss Design.
*   **Features**: 
    *   **Dual View**: Switch instantly between the web-based digital modules and the full PDF.
    *   **Robust Navigation**: Sidebar TOC with extraction for 40+ chapters.
    *   **PDF Integration**: Direct embedding of the Master's Thesis PDF.
*   **Vibe**: Serious, academic, yet strictly modern.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
*   **HTML5 / CSS3** (Vanilla + TailwindCSS via CDN)
*   **JavaScript** (ES6+)
*   **Libraries**:
    *   [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) (Animations)
    *   [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (WebGL contexts)
    *   [Lenis](https://github.com/studio-freight/lenis) (Smooth Scrolling)
    *   [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) (Icons)

## 🚀 Usage
Simply open any of the `MasterX.html` files in a modern web browser. No build step or local server is strictly required, although a local server is recommended for loading external assets (PDFs/Images) without CORS issues.
